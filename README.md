##About_this_project

          *This Project is built for online compiler IDE.The files provided in this project have few high level language program compiler and we can add features to support more high level language code.

This website is hosted in AWS:

          *HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.

          *CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

          *An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
                         Example: Visual Studio

     
          *An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.   

##Our_Project_Contains

          *README.md  - this file
          *index.html - this file contains the website main page.

##API_Used_for_our_project     

          *Coding Test Online IDE compiler uses the APIs(Link:https://rapidapi.com/hermanzdosilovic/api/judge0),it is used for executing the source code by the users.     

##About_our_site

[Coding Test]Link:www.codingtest.com.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
              * It is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and excute  code from different kind of languages(C,C++,JAVA,JAVASCRIPT,PYTHON).
              *Moreover,it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.
